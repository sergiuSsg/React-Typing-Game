Typing Game 


How many words can you type in 10 seconds?



This typing game is made with React with the use of hooks. It has 2 buttons which become disabled once the game is started: one for starting the game(which automatically moves the focus on the Text Area to be able to type straight away) and another for deleting the Top 5 HighScores which are saved in the local Storage. After every round the word count it's shown under the buttons and saved in the local Storage.
